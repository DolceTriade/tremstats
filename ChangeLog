2006-10-22 DASPRiD <mail@dasprids.de>:
	* Included parsing of teamkills. Does only work with patched server.
	* Better handling of games.log. The parser first checks now if the filesize
	  equals to 0 byte. If yes, it exists. Else it waits until the log does not
	  not grow for more than 2 seconds anymore. Then it moves it to a temporary
	  position and parses it. After parsing is done, the log is archived into a
	  local directory.

2006-10-21 DASPRiD <mail@dasprids.de>:
	* Progressbar integrated
	* Big data are now precalculated, so the MySQL server does not have to much
	  to do, when the output is calculated. This takes up 1 up to 10 more
	  seconds, depending on the data in the database, at the end of parsing.
	* Optimized MySQL table structure
	* Optimized parser speed
